Hello, Im Muhammad Vikri. I want to share how to manage your time based on my experience. I have a lot activities that I need to do even for a day. With this tips I can manage my time to clear it and have enough time for rest. I hope it can help you to manage your time even too.

## Set To Do List

Write or make to do list is the important thing to start the day. Start to think the plan before the day or in the night before tomorrow. With to do list, we can manage our time for doing more important thing first. We can reach the goal for a day, so that we feel more relaxed and get ready to face another day or another goal.

## Set Prioritize

Setting your priority, you can decide important activity to do first, like doing the easiest task first or the hardest first. By setting your priorities, you can also know which one are more most important to do.

## Focus to the Goals

Have a goal even for a day, and set another goal for the next day. With goal we know about what are we want to reach or where is our path go. We can feel satisfied after we reach the goal.

## Use tools to remind about time

Not just ourself to get ready for managing time. We can use tools that already given for reminding time of our activities. Example google calendar or calendar in smartphone, alarm, note, etc.

## Find the impact if we late or if we succeed

Knowing the impact from what we set before. Know the loss if we miss the goal, and know the benefit if we get the goal.
