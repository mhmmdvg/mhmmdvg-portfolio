**I want to tell my story** about the most memorable feedback that changes me to a better person in programming field. It all start when I was applied to one company for my internship in Kampus Merdeka. I passed evaluation in skill test, and i got invitation from that company to have an interview user.

That was my first interview test for something that I really interest about. When the interview test begin, I asked to answer some question about framework and programming language that the company use. There’s some question that I can and some question that I can’t answer. Because I have been trying to learn for a few months about the programming language that the company use. I haven’t mastered at it but I try to learn as much as I can.

At the end of my interview, the examiner told me to learn more about the programming language that the company use. Especially to learn about code without any library, because I often used library for making my code program more easily.

I take that as a feedback to have a good habit in programming. Not just in the programming language that the company use, I learn to not use library to my all my programming language that I learn. It’s difficult at first, but with more practice I can do it! I try to improve my skill in programming with that feedback, and it’s really changes me in the way I doing my program. I feel better at knowing programming language and I improve my skill with my knowledge because of that feedback. I would like to say thank you to the examiner, your feedback means a lot for me!
